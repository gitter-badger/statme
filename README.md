###Guardian #statme    
>Project built to automate twitter responses equipped with crime statistics personalized to a user's location.  The engine recognizes tweets containing both a mention of [@guardiancrime](https://twitter.com/guardiancrime) and #statme and responds with an image containing the desired statistics.    

This project is an offshoot of the Guardian Crime Project, which can be found at https://github.com/noahl98/Guardian
